## üìå Projects Overview

### 1. üè† House Price Prediction using Regression

**Objective**: Predict housing prices based on features such as location, area, number of rooms, and more.

**Techniques Used**:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R¬≤)

**Highlights**:
- Explores feature importance and correlation analysis
- Built using Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib)

### 2. ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Classification with ML Models and PCA

**Objective**: Classify whether a patient has heart disease based on medical parameters.

**Techniques Used**:
- Classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, KNN, etc.
- Ensemble Learning (Voting, Bagging, Boosting)
- Dimensionality reduction with **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

**Highlights**:
- Achieved high accuracy and precision across multiple models
- PCA used to enhance model performance and reduce overfitting

### 3. üé•üìù Video-to-Text Summarizer using ML & DL

**Objective**: Automatically generate concise text summaries from video content.

**Techniques Used**:
- Speech-to-Text (using Google Speech API or Whisper)
- NLP for summarization (TextRank, BERT, or T5)
- Deep Learning with Transformers
- Optional video processing (frame extraction, scene detection)

**Highlights**:
- Multimodal ML/DL pipeline
- Summarization output is customizable (bullet points, abstract, etc.)
- Practical application for lecture notes, meetings, content repurposing
